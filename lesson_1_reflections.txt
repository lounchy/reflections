How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is mutch easyer, using diff you get exacly those lines where was any changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In big proyects you are in constant changes, sometimes the first version 
    is better than the last one, it is powerful to have all your versions in hands

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that you can chose when to whenever you want, and the comited file
    gona be eficent for falowing. Google docs can create the comit in any time 
    so you lose control, the comit wont be eficent and you can get dizzy reading
    them

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For better change tracker, because bigest part of projects (to dont say all)
    has more than 1 file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First clone the reposatory, later compare to ids by diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is esay to move between comits and find a bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
